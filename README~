Ray Tracing N Objects with N Light Sources

README.txt

If you do not have OpenGL installed, do:
```
sudo apt-get install freeglut3  
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev  
sudo apt-get install libglew1.5  
sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev  
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa  
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev  
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx  
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev 
```

To run the code, do:
    ```
    make
    ./ray_trace
    ```
    It should take no longer than 30 seconds for GL window to pop up.
    There will be a progress bar shown in the terminal window for
    you to estimate the wait time.

    Default view is a single transparent purple sphere with one light
    source at the eye sight in front view.

To show other options, do:
    ```
    ./ray_trace -help
    ```
    Usage: ./ray_trace [-o s | m] [-l s | m] [-v l | r | c]
    -o: num of objects, can be 's' for single and 'm' for multiple. It is
     defaulted to single.
    -l: num of light source, can be 's' for single and 'm' for multiple.
     It is defaulted to single.
    -v: view angle, can be 'l' for left, 'r' for right, and 'c' for center.
     It is defaulted to center.

Example:
    To show multiple objects with multiple (2) light souce from left side, do:
    ```
    ./ray_trace -v l -o m -l m
    ```
    'Multiple light source' option includes two light from above the eye
    sight whereas 'single
    light source' includes one light at the eye sight.

Grading perspective:
    - 4 points: Ray trace one object using inverse square law
    lighting model and light source at the eye.
    - 10 points: Ray trace N superquadric objects with M main
    light sources with point-light-source shadows.
    - 3 points: Ray Tracing, add reflections.
    - 3 points: Ray Tracing, add refractions.
